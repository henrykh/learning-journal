# Learning Journal
This project is a learning journal application for the Code Fellows' Winter 2015 Python Development Accelerator. This journal comprises a PostgreSQL database of entries and a Pyramid web application for the presentation layer  


## Features
* New posts can be created and saved to the database
    * With appropriate syntax, posts will display as markdown
    * Similarly, using backticks denotes a block of code, which will be colorized to improve readibility
* Posts can be viewed from the home page or individually on their respective detail pages
* Posts can be edited from those detail pages, markdown and codeblocks can be added or edited as above
* New and edit features are secured by a login system for site admins
* Tested with pytest and lettuce
